Toon-Express-Level-Editor is a modified, easier to use level editor for making levels in Toontown.  It uses source code from Disney's in-house Toontown Online level editor that was used to quickly make and edit most streets and playgrounds.  The program uses a dna parser for DNA files, and a working Panda3D level editor.  The program was and still is very buggy and somewhat hard to use, so I decided to revamp the editor with QoL features and bug fixes. Since this program is very buggy, some DNA files are unable to be edited.  Currently TTCC and TTO DNA files have been tested and work as of now.


<br />***Note***: *This project uses code and assets made and owned by The Walt Disney Company, including files sourced from the OTP framework and Toontown's source code, which were partially released in the [RobotToonManager repository](https://github.com/ToontownFan2003/RobotToonManager) as well in code dumps done by the community.*

It currently features: <br />


> * Most assets from Toontown Online in 2013
> * The ability to add and modify visgroups
> * Panda3D level editor for modifying and creating DNA files, such as streets


New features include:

> * Auto saving feature
> * Updated controls and documentation
> * Improved suit point and battle cell placement

Features to come:

> * Full documentation/wiki
> * Transition to Python 3.x
> * Cross-platform Support (Linux)
> * General QoL updates


<h2>Installation</h2>

Note: Windows is the only OS supported as of now, Linux support will come at a later date.

1. Clone repository
2. Extract folder if compressed
3. Place phase folders from your choice of source (TTO phase files, etc) into local repository folder
4. Select *start_level_editor.bat*

A command prompt window will open, and code will start running.  Several windows will open, and will become enabled after the program is fully loaded.
